# Machine-Learning
My personal Machine Learning scripts and notes

Most algorithms require SciKit-Learn module and Neural Network (ML_NN) requires Google's Tensorflow

Scripts were written for specific datasets, but can easily be modded to any appropriate dataset. 

ML_NN is still in progressâ€“ ran into a speed bump due to lack of GPU processing on my laptop.
